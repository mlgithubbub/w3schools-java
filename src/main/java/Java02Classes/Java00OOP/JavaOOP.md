# Java OOP

## Java - What is OOP?

- OOP = `Object-Oriented Programming`
- `procedural programming`: writing procedures or methods that perform operations on data
- `object-oriented programming`: creating objects that contain both data and methods

Advantages of OOP over procedural programming:
- faster and easier to execute
- provides clear structure for programs
- helps keep Java code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself); makes code easier to maintain, modify, debug
- fully reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

DRY principle is about reducing repetition of code:
  - extract common code, place in single place, and reuse

## Java - What are Classes and Objects?

- `class`: a template for objects
- `object`: an instance of a class
- when individual objects are created, they inherit all the variable and methods from the class
