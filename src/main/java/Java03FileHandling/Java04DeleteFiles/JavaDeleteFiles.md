# Java Delete Files

## Delete a File

- use the `delete()` method to delete a file

```java
import java.io.File;  // Import the File class

public class DeleteFile {
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    File myObj = new File("filename.txt"); 
    if (myObj.delete()) { 
      System.out.println("Deleted the file: " + myObj.getName());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
    } 
  } 
}
```

## Delete a Folder

- you can also delete a folder, but it must be empty:

```java
import java.io.File; 

public class DeleteFolder {
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    File myObj = new File("C:\\Users\\MyName\\Test"); 
    if (myObj.delete()) { 
      System.out.println("Deleted the folder: " + myObj.getName());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Failed to delete the folder.");
    } 
  } 
}
```
